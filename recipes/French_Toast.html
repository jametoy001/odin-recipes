        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My daughter loves when I make this stuffed French toast. You could add some sliced fruit to the sandwich if you'd like; try bananas or strawberries. Dust with powered sugar and serve with pancake syrup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>       
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®), or more to taste</li>
                <li>4 slices cinnamon bread (such as Pepperidge Farm®) </li>
                <li>¼ cup milk </li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten </li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
                <li>cooking spray </li>
            </ul>             
        <h2>Steps</h2>   
            <ol>
                <li>Spread 1 tablespoon chocolate-hazelnut spread onto one side of each of 2 slices cinnamon bread; top each with another bread slice to make 2 sandwiches.</li>
                <li>Beat milk, egg, and vanilla extract together in a shallow bowl until smooth. Soak each sandwich in the milk mixture until the bread is moistened, about 15 seconds per side.</li>
                <li>Prepare a nonstick pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Cook sandwiches in the hot pan until browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip sandwiches and continue cooking until other side is browned, about 1 minute more.</li>
            </ol>
